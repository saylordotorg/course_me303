**Unit 6: Cooling and Refrigeration** <span id="6"></span> 
*You may be familiar with different types of cooling equipment and
operations.  All of these involve the transfer of energy from a high
temperature source to a low temperature sink.  The cooling of your body
by a combination of convective heat transfer and evaporation of sweat is
an example with which you are certainly familiar.  It has much in common
with the operation of the cooling towers you may associate with large
power plants.  Another familiar example involves the absorption of heat
at low temperature by the expansion of a gas and the rejection of that
heat at a higher temperature by the compression of a gas.  This type of
operation can be found in a home air conditioner or refrigerator. *

     Instructions: This resource contains a comprehensive discussion of
    refrigeration and air conditioning from a mechanical engineering
    perspective and will be used throughout this unit as a resource. 
    More specific lessons from this resource will be assigned as
    readings as you navigate this unit.  Many of the lessons are also
    available in video format on YouTube; for example, see this YouTube
    link on [psychrometry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqpR7udHBEA)
    or this one on the [history of
    refrigeration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqXgmVnI3L8&feature=channel). 
    The text also contains example problems and solutions.  Please note
    that many sections of this unit contain review material to which you
    have already been exposed.
