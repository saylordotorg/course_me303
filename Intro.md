This course deals with the transfer of work, energy, and material via
gases and liquids.  These fluids may undergo changes in temperature,
pressure, density, and chemical composition during the transfer process
and may act on or be acted on by external systems.  You must fully
understand these processes if you are an engineer working to analyze,
troubleshoot, or improve existing processes and/or innovate and design
new ones. In your everyday life, you will likely encounter examples of
the thermal-fluid systems we will study in this course.  Consider the
following scenarios:
1.  Read this recent
    [report](http://gtalumni.org/Publications/magazine/sum98/einsrefr.html)
    by Gary Goettling for the Georgia Tech Alumni Association.\*  In it,
    Goettling describes a refrigeration system with no moving parts
    based on improvements to a patent filed by Einstein and Szilard in
    1930.  As an engineer, how would you go about evaluating this design
    for energy efficiency, safety, reliability, and manufacturing,
    operating, and installation costs?
2.  Have you ever wondered how the level sensor on a retail gasoline
    dispenser automatically shuts off when the gasoline tank in an
    automobile is full?
3.  Have you ever been tempted to share your opinion concerning the
    debates about global climate change?  Global climate involves
    consideration of radiation, convection, and chemical change amongst
    many other factors.
4.  Have you wondered how it is possible to estimate the composition and
    flow rate of a mixture of petroleum, water, and natural gas at a
    remote location five miles under the ocean surface.
5.  Just how dirty do your air filters need to be in your domestic air
    handling system or on your motor vehicle for it to be economically
    advantageous to replace them?

All of these questions can be addressed in part by applying the
fundamentals of energy, momentum, and mass transfer to specific
situations.  You have studied these fundamentals in your Thermodynamics
([ME103](http://www.saylor.org/courses/me103/)), Heat Transfer
([ME204](http://www.saylor.org/courses/me204/)), Mechanics
([ME102](http://www.saylor.org/courses/me102/) and
[ME202](http://www.saylor.org/courses/me202/)), and Fluid Mechanics
([ME201](http://www.saylor.org/courses/me201/)) courses.  This course
will give you the opportunity to review and reinforce these fundamentals
by applying them to slightly more complex and practical situations and
systems.  In doing so, you will learn to connect engineering science
with practice. This course will not exhaustively cover all the types of
processes and equipment that you may encounter as an engineer.  Instead,
it will provide you with experience connecting engineering fundamentals
with a few applications so that you have the ability and confidence to
address new situations as they emerge.  Each of the sections subsequent
to the first review portion is accompanied by suggested reading,
calculations, and exercises to assist you. \* Please respect the

### Course Information

Welcome to **ME303:** **Thermal-Fluid Systems**. General information
about this course and its requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Course Designer:** [Dr. Steve
Gibbs](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-a-g/#DrSteveGibbs)  
    
 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned material.
All units build on previous units, so it will be important to progress
through the course in the order presented.  
  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assessments at the end of each unit in this course.   
  
 In order to *pass* this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.   
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
approximately **114 hours** to complete. Each unit includes a time
advisory that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each
subunit and assignment. These time advisories should help you plan your
time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at the time advisories
before beginning this course in order to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit. Then, you can set
goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you approximately 13
hours to complete. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete the Introductory Review (a total of 3 hours) on
Monday night, Subunit 1.1 (a total of 3 hours) on Tuesday and Subunit
1.2 (2 hours) on Wednesday night, etc.
