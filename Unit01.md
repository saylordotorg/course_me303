    to review other sections of the GSU’s [Hyperphysics
    pages](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/) (HTML).
    For example, you may review the definitions of the state variables
    enthalpy, internal energy, and entropy.  To access these
    definitions, click on the hyperlink for each term in the Index on

    such as momentum, velocity, force, work, energy, and power.  Make
    sure that you understand both the physical meaning of the quantities
    and the units of that quantity.  For example, velocity is a vector
    indicating the speed and direction of movement with units of
    length/time.  Note that a very large number of units can be derived
    from the fundamental units.

    3](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Fluid-Mechanics_Ch3.pdf)”
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read only Section 1 of this chapter.  This material
    is rather dense, so you may wish to spend some time thinking about
    it and drawing pictures.  
        
     Note that much of engineering analysis is concerned with the
    consequences of the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy.  You
    might consider an engineer to be an accountant of such quantities;
    the engineer considers the generation, accumulation or depletion,
    and motion from place to place of such quantities.  This accounting
    may be done for finite containers or volumes or differential
    (infinitesimal) volume elements.  This material should be a review
    for you.
