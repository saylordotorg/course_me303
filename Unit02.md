**Unit 2: Measurement of Flow** <span id="2"></span> 
*In order to assess pumping and piping operations, you must know the
mass and volumetric flow rates and velocities in the system, which you
can infer from the pressure differences and resulting actions upon
various sensors.  Some of these methods may seem as crude as watching a
weather vane or the motion of a flag in the wind, but they can be
essential for monitoring equipment and process performance.  *
