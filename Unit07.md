**Unit 7: Power Conversion** <span id="7"></span> 
*The subject of power conversion is vast, encompassing processes as
diverse as nuclear reactions and the dynamics of life.  In this section,
you will study a few common examples of power conversion systems that
you may encounter as an engineer.  Typically, these involve the
interchange of chemical, mechanical, and electrical energy.*
