     Instructions: Read this Wiki article and take notes to concisely
    describe flow rate, operating speed, efficiency, cavitation or gas
    binding, and power consumption.  In the readings in this subunit,
    you will examine the operating characteristics of centrifugal pumps
    in detail.  This reading will provide you with a generic description
    of the centrifugal pump, while the next few resources will review
    the ways in which different manufacturers describe the performance
    of their products.  You will have to adapt your thinking to
    accommodate the jargon and preferred units of each manufacturer. 
    This sort of activity is common for the engineer.
