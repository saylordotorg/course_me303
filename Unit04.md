**Unit 4: Piping Networks** <span id="4"></span> 
*Piping networks are useful for moving fluids from points of generation
or storage to points of use or disposal.  Think for a moment about the
many piping systems in an automobile: fuel lines from the storage tank
to each cylinder of the engine; exhaust lines from the cylinders to the
tailpipe; coolant lines from the engine block to the radiator; and
conduits for ventilation and temperature regulation of the passenger
compartment, amongst many others.  You will learn in this unit how to
approach problems associated with materials compatibility, pressure
losses, and vibration and anchoring in fluid piping systems.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 15 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 4.1: 3 hours

☐    Subunit 4.2: 5 hours

☐    Exercise 4.3: 6 hours

☐    End of Unit Self-Assessment: 1 hour

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

-   Describe physical characteristics of standard pipes and fittings.
-   Calculate pressure drops for specific flows through specific pipes
    and fittings.
-   Calculate forces resulting from flow through bends and other
    fittings.
