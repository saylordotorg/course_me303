**Unit 5: Heat Exchangers** <span id="5"></span> 
*Heat exchangers are commonplace in a wide variety of situations that
you encounter on a daily basis.  They involve the transfer of heat
energy from one fluid to another through physical proximity and involve
simultaneous conductive and convective heat transfer.  Some common
examples include the radiators (a bit of a misnomer) used to remove heat
from automobile engines, the coils used to transfer heat from the inside
of a refrigerator to the outside, the large ears of some mammals (which
can aid in cooling), and the fins on a computer chip.  In this unit, you
will learn about the importance of fluid mechanics, exchanger geometry,
and flow configuration in heat exchanger efficiency.*
